# - Each algorithm has strenghts and weakness. So we can combine them
# - Example, blend collaborative filtering with popularity: make sure people get relevant items for them AND try to make sure they will like it
# 
# 
# - Means of Hibidrization:
#     - Combine Items Scores
#     
#     Linear Blends or feature weighting linear scaling (as more ratings an item has, the less emphasis is put on a content based and more weight to the rank of the collaborative filtering is given for example)
#     - Combine Item Ranks: Combina based on Output, not score
#     - Integrated Models
#     
# - Advanced Models:
#     - Conditionally Switch Models
#     - Deep Integration (Putting content based computations inside a collaborative filtering)
#     
# - Matrix Factorization on Hibrid Data - SVD++ or SVDFeatures? No ideas..
# 
# - Netflix Challenge - Crazy stuff not real for real life
# 
# - Learning to Rank - FunkSVD for example
#      - How do we generalise this idea?
